I am a naturally adventurous person so I thought I would live a little and just give it a try. Big mistake. I ordered the 'best burger' last night and am still dealing with problems from the meal. First of all, the burger sucks. It's just plain not good. The patty was really gooey and was a softer consistency than the buns- something that should have been impossible because they were literally falling apart. I almost had to cut it with a knife and fork. Degrading. Next, I found a bone or a pebble or something very hard in the burger. Not cool. I decided to forge on because, as I said, I am a naturally adventurous person. The final straw came on bite 4 when I pulled a needle out of my mouth. I had to go to the ER and wait around for 3 hours before a doctor saw me. The staff there were also very rude, but I guess that is unrelated to this restaurant. Overall, very bad experience and would not recommend. I used to say I would try anything twice but now I am not so sure. The fries were good though!",
